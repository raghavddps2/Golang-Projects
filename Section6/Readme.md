# Interfaces

    1. Suppose we have to write a shuffle function for different types of arrays, 
        that would be very reduandant. We need to come up with a way that gives a generalized 
        solution.
    2. The sample program that we are going to write out is of the Spanish and the English Bot which has
        two basic functions, getGreeting() and printGreeting().
    3. getGreeting() will simply return the greeting whereas the printGreeting function
        just calls the getGreeting().
    4. In cases, the logic or code inside a function will be very logical, where printGreeting 
        function will have kind of identical code.
